# CarbonNanotubesSoftware
Software for calculation of single and multiwall carbon nanotubes properties, probability of failure of a carbon fibre, 
elastic modulus of fibre/matrix, Young's modulus of elastic beam, etc.   The software is written in C# in Visual Studio 2015 and 
using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), Windows Forms and gives the possibility of exporting/importing in XML files the 
resulted calculations.  The software is in pre-alpha stage of development so any comments/contributions are welcome at the email address 
galenpalimpsestproject@gmail.com .  It is provided here with no warranty. The license for the software is in a different file.

To move through the calculations, it is needed to press the buttons "Page 1", "Page 2", etc. 

One of the scope of the software would have been to implement in C# finite element and probabilistic finite element simulations 
in a distributed computing fashion in order to reduce the computational time. However, the "Distributed Connectivity" is not doing really 
anything only connecting to the local host 127.0.0.1
